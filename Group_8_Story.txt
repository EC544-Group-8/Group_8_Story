This is the story of Pierre the Pear (not to be confused with Pierre the Bear).

he has no arms.

Of course...since he is a Pear...not a bear.

He stares into the abyss.

Suddenly, he has a revelation.

he still has no arms

At least he's still got a stem.

Soon, someone will take a big bite out of his juicy behind.
